3. **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity Matching**  
   Your resume is vectorized using **TF-IDF**, and compared with the target role’s required skills to compute similarity and fit score.

4. **Skill Analysis & Visualization**  
   Displays matched and missing skills, with a dynamic progress bar for percentage match.

5. **Recommendations**  
   - Missing skills → Udemy course links  
   - Role-based interview questions (future addition)
